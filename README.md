#PDEs in Python

In this project we'll start by solving the laplace/poisson and the diffusion equation
using the finite difference method.
We'll move to solve the advection equation using the finite volume method using the
upwing scheme.
Finally we'll solve the burgers equation using the finite volume method using 
the Godunov scheme.
All of the coding will be done in python.
